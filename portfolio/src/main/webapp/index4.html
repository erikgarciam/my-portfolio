        <h2><strong> Interests and Hobbies </strong></h2>

        <h3><bold>Star Wars</bold><h3>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><em>One of my interests is actually
         Star Wars. I really do enjoy most aspects of star wars like the 
         rich story that it brings and the interesting characters. I 
         do watch the movies, tv shows, read the comics, and play the 
         video games to keep up with information.

        <h3><bold>Halo</bold><h3>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><em>Another interest of mine has been 
             the Halo franchise because of the compelling story and interesting
             characters. The story of Halo also interweaves the the Halo book
             series, meaning side characters get more depth than they do in the 
             video games which makes reading a big plus.
