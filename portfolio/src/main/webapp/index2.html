        <h2 style="color:white"><strong> About Me </strong></h2>

         <p style="text-align:center;">I was born in Paramount, California. 
             Around five years later we moved to the High Desert and the city of 
             Hesperia, California. I lived there all the way though highschool.
             I still refer Hesperia as home base since most of my family and 
             friends are located there.
             <br><br>
             In High School I had enrolled in a Class called IT Essentials where I 
             learned that technology was my passion. It is through IT Essentials 
             that I enrolled into Cisco's Networking Academy. It was through these
             joint opportunities that I learned more about computers and networking. 
             These skills by themselves weren't enough for me though because I also 
             wanted to learn how computers and software work. When applying to the 
             university I already knew I wanted a mix of hardware and software mixed 
             in so I applied for a major in Computer Engineering.
             <br>
             <br>
             I then embarked on my university journey and am now a rising junior, which 
             means I will be starting my third year at California State University, Fullerton.
